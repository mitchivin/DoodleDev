# DoodleDev

**The web shouldn't make your designs look worse.**

DoodleDev is a visual development tool built to bridge the gap between high-fidelity design and production code. It allows you to build complex front-end interfaces and export them as clean, single web components with every detail intact.

## The Philosophy
Most web tools force you to compromise your vision just to fit into a browser. DoodleDev was built on a simple premise: **If you can design it, you should be able to ship it.** No more losing the polish when your interface hits the actual code.

## Features
* **Pixel-Perfect Export:** Interfaces are exported as portable web components.
* **No Layout Compromise:** Break free from the generic "box" constraints of standard builders.
* **Framework Agnostic:** Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla HTML/JS.
* **High Fidelity:** Every shadow, bevel, and custom interaction remains exactly as designed.

## Usage
DoodleDev generates custom elements that drop into any project with zero friction.
