# DoodleDev

Visual editor that writes the code for you as you design.

Draw layouts, shapes, and components on a canvas and get clean HTML / CSS / JS you can drop straight into your project.

## What DoodleDev is

DoodleDev is a visual design-to-code tool.

You design on a grid. As you move, resize, or restyle elements, the code updates instantly. There is no AI translation step and no conversion process.

You can:

- Place elements on a grid with exact positioning  
- Layer shapes with z index  
- Style fills, borders, radius, shadows, and fonts  
- Export clean HTML / CSS (JS when needed)  
- Use the export in any normal web project

The goal is real code a developer would actually ship. No frameworks. No dependencies. The export runs offline.

---

## What it is *not*

- Not “upload a sketch and get a website”  
- Not generic AI conversion  
- Not trying to replace full design tools

---

## Current status

- Phase: public test build  
- Stability: expect rough edges and rapid changes  
- Export: static HTML & CSS with readable structure

Treat the export as a starting point. You’re allowed to modify it.

---

## Core idea

**Design visually. Export real code.**  
No guessing. No magic. What you see is what gets written.

---

## Roadmap (high level)

This will change, but roughly:
 
- Better typography controls  
- More shape options & gradients  
- Saved projects and version history  
- Component presets  
- More control over export templates

## Feedback & issues

If something feels wrong, open an issue and include:

- What you tried to do  
- What you expected  
- What actually happened  
- Browser and OS  
- Screenshots or exported code (if relevant)
